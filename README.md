# Hi, I'm PawPrints

I'm a happy little site selling adorable prints!

I was built by Charity, Eric, Ian, and Jimmy during Fullstack Academy's 1610 Software Engineering Immersive.

### Live Site (Deployed with Heroku)

**Instructions**

To run a PawPrints server:
1. Clone from the GitHub repository
2. In Node, run 'npm install --dev'
3. Then, run 'npm run setup' 
4. Finally, run 'npm start'

PawPrints will then be available at <a href ="http://localhost:1337/" target="_blank">http://localhost:1337/</a> as long as the 'npm start' process is running on your machine. (Optionally, if you run 'npm run build-watch' in a separate terminal at the same time, the server will live-update with any file changes as they are saved.)
